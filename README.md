# plant-range-shift-syst-map.github.io

Website hosting systematic map review of plant species range shift studies (1990-2020)

The code for this webpage has come from EviAtlas (https://estech.shinyapps.io/eviatlas/) and autocreated using the GUI using my own csv data.

If you would like to host your own systematic map for free via github, you can watch this great youtube video which will show you how: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igsxx_5RBB4
